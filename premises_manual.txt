# Knowledge base for MANUAL (paper) inference
# Tasks (manual): Determine whether each of the following is derivable, and justify:
#   Q1: operations_continue
#   Q2: site_closed
#   Q3: hazard
#   Q4: evacuation
#
# Facts
fact: leak_detected
fact: power_on
fact: valve_closed
fact: supervisor_present
# Note: 'trained_staff' is NOT a fact.

# Rules
leak_detected & power_on -> alarm
alarm & supervisor_present -> response_team_called
response_team_called & valve_closed -> pressure_isolated
pressure_isolated & leak_detected -> hazard_mitigated
leak_detected & valve_closed -> pressure_builds
pressure_builds & leak_detected -> hazard
hazard & response_team_called -> site_closed
hazard_mitigated & power_on -> operations_continue
response_team_called & trained_staff -> evacuation
